# JIRA-RnD
Notes on the JIRA set-up information

Objective: To establish whether we can help create a template/add-on for our clients using JIRA to use to help save information about their R&D tasks as and when they enter it into JIRA. Examples include: https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/sredio-jira/cloud/overview and http://www.entax.ca/resources/sredtrak/. Both are Canadian apps designed to help companies in that country claim the local R&D tax incentive. The first out of the two is a free add-on, which we can add to our own instance of JIRA and see what workflows/categories of information they have to help guide us. This add-on can only be used on a JIRA cloud instance. So, this needs to be done on our free 7-day trial version of JIRA cloud.

Proposed steps:
1. Start free cloud trial for JIRA
2. Install SREDIO on the cloud version to play around and investigate what it has to offer
3. Play around on JIRA cloud (as much as possible) in terms of setting up different task and category types to help our clients capture contemporaneous R&D evidence.
4. Once the trial version of JIRA cloud is finished, we can setup the JIRA server version (need to liaise with RWTS) and continue step 4.
5. Investigate the possibility of developing our own add-on (similar to Sredio) to allow our clients to use this as an add-on to capture their R&D work.
6. Investigate various types of workflows and rules that can be implemented in JIRA to supplement our objective - either to include in the add-on or to allow us to propose as 'best practices' or a template we can supply to our clients.
